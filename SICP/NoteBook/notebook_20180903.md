## Data Abstraction

### Compound data

how to implement the rational number operation?
$$\frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4} $$
$$\frac{3}{4} \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{1}{2}$$

so we make the {Numerator，denominator} to a pair

$$(make-rat (N D)) \rightarrow N D $$
$$(NUMER (N D)) \rightarrow N $$
$$(DENOW (N D)) \rightarrow D $$

let's try use pseudo-code
```
(define (+Rat x y)
    (make-rat
        (+ (* (NUMER X) (DENOM y)
           (* (NUMER Y) (DENOM X))))
        (* (DENOM x) (DENOM y))))

(define (*Rat x y)
    (make-rat
        (* (NUMER X) (NUMER Y)
        (* (DENOM X) (DENOM Y)))))
```
Once we have such operation, we could do like these

$$(x+y) * (s+t) \rightarrow (*Rat\ (+Rat\ x\ y) (+Rat\ s\ t))$$

### list structure -- create PAIRS

In lisp, PAIRS could be created by using cons

for example
```
(cons x y), PAIR, first ele is x, second ele is y
(car p), select the first of P
(cdr p), select the second of P
```
```
(car (cons x y)) is x
(cdr (cons x y)) is y
```

```
(define (make-rat N D)
    (cons N D))

(define (NUMER X) (car x))
(define (NUMER X) (cdr x))
```

but these method have issues
```
(define A (make-rat 1 2))
(define B (make-rat 1 4))
(define Ans (+Rat A B))
(NUMER Ans) -> 6
(DEMON Ans) -> 8

the answer not 3/4

(define (make-art n d)
    (let ((g (gcd nd))))
    (cons (/ n g)
          (/ d g)))
```

let's see the level represent

```
+rat *rat -rat

make-rat/numer/denom

  data abstraction
```

## CLOSURE

eg. we have a pair of numbers, and pairs of the pair of number

+ 如果某种数据对象满足闭包的性质，那么通过它组合起来的数据对象得到的结果本身还可以通过同样的操作再进行组合

such as if I want to get the length between two point in X-Y cordinate

$$ s = \sqrt{(x1-x2)^2 + (y1-y2)^2}$$

 if we use closure
```
(define (length s)
    (let
        ((dx (-(xor (seg-end s))
               (xor (seg-start s))))
         (dy (-(yor (seg-end s))
               (yor (seg-start s))))))
    (sqrt (+ (square dx)
             (square dy))))
```
if we don't use closure
```
(define (length s)
    (let ((dx (-cdr((car s) (cdr (cdr s)))))))\
......

hard to read and hard to modify
```

## What's the pair itself
```
(define (cons a b)
    (lambda(pick)
        (cond ((= pick 1) a)
              ((= pick 2) b))))

(define (car x) (x 1))
(define (cdr x) (x 2))
```
