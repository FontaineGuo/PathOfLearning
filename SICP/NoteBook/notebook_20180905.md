# Chapter 2 

## List

```
1_ -> 2_ => 3_ -> 4_nil
```

the list have such implement
```
( cons 1
    (
        cons 2
        (
            cons 3
            (
                cons 4 nil))))
```
but also could implement like this 

```
(list 1 2 3 4)

(define 1-to-4 (list 4))
(car (cdr 1-to-4)) -> 2
```

## Map

How to implment this
```
(scale-list 10 1-to-4) -> (10 20 30 40)
```

let's do like this 
```
(define (scale-list s l)
    (if (null ? 1)
        nil
        (cons ((* (car l) s)
              (scale-list s (cdr l))))))
```

that's the map, the procedure will return a new object

```
(define (map p l)
    (if (null ? 1)
        nil
        (cons (p (car l))
              (map p (cdr l)))))

```

if implement map, could implement scale like this
```
(define (scale list items factor)
    (map (lambda (item) (* item factor))
    items))
```

how about for-each
```
(define (for-each proc list)
    (cond ((null ? list) 'done')
          (else (proc (car list))
                (for-each proc (cdr list)))))
```

p.s 
```
MAP build a new object ,but for-each just operate on original object
```
