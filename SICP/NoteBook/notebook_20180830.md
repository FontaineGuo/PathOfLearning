# Chapter 1

## Construct procedure abstraction

## 1. Lisp

+ black-box abstraction 
```
      ______
     | find |
36 ->| sqrt |->6
     |______|
      
what inside the box is not important
``` 

+ Primitive Objects
  + Procedures
  + Data
  

+ Means of Combination
+ Means of Abstraction
+ Capturing common pattern

## 2. The same idea act in different situation, General idea

```
The way of controlling that kind of complexity

make the procedure to [interface to interface]
```

###  how to organize this general idea
+ oop
+ make new language to specific the feature of one aspect
+ streams

## 3. When meet a new language
+ primitive element ?
  + Find primitive element of this language
  ```
  Such as python, the list and tuple are the primitve element
  ``` 
+ Means of Combination ?
  ```
  Lisp: prefix expression
  eg:
  >>>    (+ 3 5)
  >>>    8
  ```

+ Means of abstraction

## 4. lisp define a procedure

```
this is how to define a procedure:

      (define (square x) (* x x))

Although this is a syntax sugar of lisp,
is about to make easier to repersent expression,
this procedure is the same as follow:

      (define square (LAMBDA(x) (* x x)))

```

## 5. lisp cond & if
```
(define (ABS x)
      (cond ((< x 0)(-x))
            ((= x 0) 0)
            ((> x 0) x)))

(define (abs x)
      (if (< x 0)
          (- x)
          x))
```
